### About this app

This app is an admin dashboard for a pretend shop. It was built using React, Syncfusion and Tailwind and displays a variety of different components to showcase the ability of these frameworks and for me to practie utilizing React and it's add-ons.

There are many seperate tabs accessible via the collapsible sidebar including dummy shop data, dummy charts (pie, line, bar, pyramid etc...) and a variety of applications including a calendar, kanban board, color-picker and text editor.

Many of these charts are interactive and the user can choose to add or remove data simply by clicking on the items in the chart legend.

## Functionality & Key Features

The app allows users to access settings in the bottom right and change the colour as well as activate dark mode if so desired.

The site is fully adjustable for screen sizes ranging from mobile to desktop.

I followed a tutorial created by JavaScriptMastery to become more proficient with JavaScript and React, learn more key principles and best practices and to build my portfolio.

The admin-dashboard has been deployed on Netlify can be viewed here:
